MenuLine is a web application that allows you to create menus for their restaurants. It is built using the [Framework7](http://framework7.io/) and [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/).

## Story

In 2019 I was eating in a restaurant in my hometown and I noticed that the menu was not very well organized, out of date and the paper was worn out. So me and my friend [Baran Toprak Åženkul](https://github.com/vielenand) decided to create a web application that allows you to create menus for their restaurants. So they could print a qr code and put it on the table. So the customers can scan the qr code and see the menu on their phone.

Even though menus in qr code today is a very common thing in restaurants, it was not popular in 2019. especially before the pandemic. So this idea was innovative at the time.

Until 2020 this idea remained on paper. But in 2020, the pandemic started and restaurants were closed. So we decided to take this project to the next level and make it a reality.

Unfortunately, in 2020 we were busy with the University Entrance Exam and we couldn't work on this project. and by that time qr code menus became very popular. So we decided to make this project open source and stop working on it.

## Features

- In the web application you can see menus in a very organized way.
- InApp qr code scanner helps you to scan the qr code without any third party app.
